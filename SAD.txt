ðŸ“˜ Unit 1: System Development Fundamentals (9 Hrs)
a. The Systems Development Environment
Introduction: Purpose of System Analysis & Design (SA&D) is to improve business processes with technology.

Modern Approach of SA&D: Iterative, user-focused, flexible.

Information System Types:

TPS (Transaction Processing Systems)

MIS (Management Information Systems)

DSS (Decision Support Systems)

ESS (Executive Support Systems)

Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Planning â†’ Analysis â†’ Design â†’ Implementation â†’ Maintenance.

Heart of Systems Development: Understanding user needs and business processes.

Traditional Waterfall SDLC: Step-by-step, structured, but rigid.

Improving Development Approaches:

CASE Tools: Computer-aided software engineering tools.

RAD: Rapid Application Development â€“ faster prototyping.

SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture â€“ uses web services.

Agile Methodologies: Iterative, user feedback focused.

Extreme Programming (XP): Short development cycles, frequent releases.

OOAD: Object-Oriented Analysis & Design â€“ focuses on real-world modeling.

b. The Origins of Software
System Acquisition: Buy vs. build software.

Software Reuse: Using existing software modules/libraries to save time and cost.

c. Managing the Information Systems Project
Project Management Basics: Time, cost, scope, and quality.

Scheduling Techniques: Gantt Charts, PERT/CPM.

Project Management Tools: MS Project or similar software to plan, track, and manage resources.

ðŸ“˜ Unit 2: Planning (7 Hrs)
a. Identification and Selection
Project Selection: Based on business needs, feasibility, strategic alignment.

Corporate & IS Planning: Align IS goals with business strategies.

b. Initiation and Planning
Initiating Projects: Understanding the need/problem.

Planning Projects:

Identify objectives and scope.

Define project constraints and assumptions.

Feasibility Analysis:

Technical

Economic

Operational

Schedule

Baseline Project Plan: A detailed initial plan before project starts.

ðŸ“˜ Unit 3: Analysis (13 Hrs)
a. System Requirements
Requirement Determination: What the system must do (functional/non-functional).

Traditional Methods:

Interviews

Questionnaires

Document Analysis

Observation

Contemporary Methods:

JAD (Joint Application Development)

Prototyping

Radical Methods:

Business Process Reengineering (BPR)

Requirements Management Tools:

Tools like JIRA, Trello for managing requirements.

Agile Requirements:

User Stories

Product Backlog

Sprint Planning

b. System Process Requirements
Modeling system processes using:

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

Flowcharts

Use Case Diagrams (for OOAD)

âœ… Tips for Exam Preparation
Make flashcards for terms like SDLC, RAD, JAD, BPR, Agile, SOA.

Draw diagrams: Waterfall model, DFDs, Gantt chart samples.

Practice short notes on each methodology.

Revise differences: Agile vs. Waterfall, RAD vs. Traditional, etc.
